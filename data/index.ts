            <p>Empyrean sponsored Nelson Hall to conduct a research study, interviewing 100 HR & Benefits leaders on the key HR-related issues that need to be addressed as part of an organization’s corporate strategy over the next 1-2 years and the extent to which benefits operations is key to employee experience and retention. <a href="https://lp.goempyrean.com/nelson-hall/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Request a copy of the report</a>.</p>

            <p>The results of that research were used to build a Benefits Maturity Assessment. Over the next few minutes, you’ll answer a series of questions that will indicate your performance relative to that of your peers. Based on your responses, we will suggest actions to help increase your impact and uplift the capability of your benefits function, including a spider chart to indicate your overall maturity as a benefits function.</p>`,

            <p>
              Your maturity was calculated using the data collected from the NelsonHall research study: “The Changing Role of Benefits Leaders survey.” This primary research, sponsored by Empyrean, surveyed 100 HR & Benefits leaders, and was published in early 2022. The resulting report explored the changing role of the benefits function, uncovering the insights, tools, products, partners, and education needed to best serve the HR function and the broader organization. The research also explored the evolving demands on benefits platforms to uncover how these technologies must evolve to support the changing role of benefits leaders. Request a copy of the report.
              Recommendations to enhance your benefits capability are suggested below, based upon the primary research and NelsonHall market knowledge.

                While your benefits may support most employees’ needs based on your overall
                demographic profile, it is important to continue maintaining the momentum and
                to further enhance the contribution of benefits to the individual employee

                There may be scope to increase your involvement in benefits evaluation and
                selection and identify the changes in benefits required to progress wider
                strategic objectives. HR leaders would like the benefits team to show how
                benefits are influencing employee behaviors and identify the changes in
                benefits required to progress wider strategic objectives

                Employee benefits have evolved significantly. Employees now expect a broader
                range of supplemental benefits, making total employee wellness a significant

                There is likely scope to enhance your benefits experience around mental health
                and wellness. This has become highly important in recent years but still needs
                to be achieved in most organizations. The mental health of many employees has
                been severely impacted by the pandemic and the switch to work-from-home.
                Indeed, just 12% of benefits leaders (14% of HR leaders) are highly satisfied
                with their organization’s current mental health support. Over 80% of both
                benefits and HR leaders perceive a need for significant improvement.

                Activities that could be undertaken to address total wellbeing at an

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Enhance your knowledge of types of voluntary benefits and consider expanding

                </li>

                  Consider offering financial wellness if not already provided. Given the

                  ensuring employees are adequately supported where pockets are pinched and
                  living costs are increasing. Even if it is not used, knowing it is available

                <li>

                  Increase employee awareness of telehealth as an option. Employees and their
                  family members have grown more comfortable with telehealth services for
                  their convenience and ease of use, and the practice is set to become

                “The Changing Role of Benefits Leaders” research found that the functionality
                of current benefits administration platforms still frequently needs upgrading
                in terms of its analytics capability, and benefits and HR leaders also concur
                that further skills development in this area is required. Only 50% of
                respondents perceive that the analytics functionality of their current
                benefits administration platform is helping the function to understand &
                optimize program performance.

                Both benefits and HR leaders agree that analytics capability is needed to
                assess plan providers and plan quality as well as understand & optimize
                benefits program performance. This requires the benefits team to possess data
                management and data analytics skills and have access to high-level dashboards
                to provide ongoing insights into benefits performance.
